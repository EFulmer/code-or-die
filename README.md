- requires coding (from an automation perspective: scripts, reports, bots)
- is newbie-friendly

STORY
=====

In the year 10328, the Titanus people first ventured out from thir homeworld Titanus Earth. It was the year they discovered faster-than-light travel, through the warping of subspace. But barely had they sent their first expedition to what they would call New Earth, did Titanian scientists make two discoveries that would change the galaxy:

- the hyperrelay, a method of instanteous communication to any point in the galaxy
- the beam motivator, a city-sized distortion generator that would allow near-instanteous transport along a tightly calibrated corridor of warped subspace

It was a time of great hope for the Titanian people. Dreaming of a pan-Galactic Titanian empire, the people of Titanus Earth joined together to face their destiny as a unified peoples.

And little did they know... that the beam motivator, the tool that would enable them to grow and prosper, didn't merely warp subspace. With each warp, subspace would bend, it might tear, or it invert, but it would always eventually destory.

And little did they know... they weren't the only explorers.

GAME MECHANICS
==============
At the start of the game, teams control two outposts:
- their home planet
- one remote output

Teams lose if:
- their home planet is sacked or destroyed

The game is over if:
- all but one team is defeated
- a predetermined time limit expires (representing catastrophic, galactic subspace inversion)
- all subspace returns to normal

The winning team is the team that controls the most outposts at the end of the game.

The game is played in real-time via JSON API requests against this game engine.

Players control individual units and outposts via API requests.

MAP
---

The map can be autogenerated as a `networkx` graph. The map should be large enough to force players to eventually build coding tools to automate control of their units. At first, these coding tools may be simple shell scripts to automate API calls. Teams may want to build reporting scripts or web frontends to better represent information. Advanced teams may want to create bots to automate unit movement.

The galaxy map is a collection of nodes (planets/outposts) and edges, representing possible FTL travel between.

Nodes are weighted by their productive capacity. Edges are weighted by FTL travel time in seconds.

Teams have complete visibility of any outposts they control. Teams can see all adjacent nodes to any outposts they control.

Teams have complete visibility of any outposts where they have units positioned. Teams have no adjacent-node visibility unless they control an outpost.

Visibilty allows teams to see
- total unit strength of all parties present
- current controlling part of outpost beam motivator

UNITS
-----

All units are identical.

Units can be instructed to travel to a destination (node-by-node fast-travel) via FTL or beam.

Beam travel is nearly instantaneous. FTL travel time is based on edge weights. All travel is node-by-node. Travel destination must be specified on an immediate-next-node basis.

Unit actions belong to a queue (to facilitate multi-hop travel and complex actions.) Queued actions can be canceled.

Units can be instructed to participate in combat. Combat is locked to 30 second rounds. Combat occurs on a regiment-vs-regiment basis. Unit strength between combat parties is compared. Winner is party with greater unit strength. At end of combat round, loser loses 10% of unit strength plus 10% for each double of attacker strength.

e.g., A and B engage in combat. A has 55 units. B has 50 units. A has more units and is the winner. B has fewer units and is the loser. B loses 10% of total unit strength (5 units.) A has 55 units remaining. B has 50-5=45 units remaining.

e.g., A and B engage in combat. A has 100 units. B has 50 units. A has more units and is the winner. B has fewer units and is the loser. B loses 10% of total unit strength (5 units) and another 10% of total unit strength, because A has double the number of units. A has 100 units remaining. B has 50-5-5=40 units remaining.

**TODO:** can winner ever lose units?
**TODO:** how do we do >2 party combat?

OUTPOSTS
--------

Outposts can be controlled by teams. Teams can take control of any uncontrolled outpost. Teams can release control of any outpost at any time. Teams can contest control of an outpost currently controlled by another party.

When contesting control of an outpost, the party with the most units present gains control. Only the party controlling the outpost and the party contesting control are considered.

Teams can send private messages to all units in vicinity of any outpost where they have a positioned unit.

**IDEA:** upon gaining control of an outpost, controlling party can see beam tuning parameters for every previous transit.Can they also see all past transit records? This means teams will have to "hide" their homeworlds.

e.g., Team A controls New Earth II and has 100 units stationed there. Team B, an ally, moves 10 units to New Earth II. Team A can relase control of outpost. Team B can immediately take control of outpost, as it is uncontrolled. Team C moves 50 units to New Earth II. Team C can contest and win control of New Earth II, because Team C has 50 units vs current controlling Team B's 10 units. Team A can immediately contest control from Team C, with team A winning, because it has the most units.

BEAM MOTIVATORS
---------------

Units can attempt near-instantaneously travel between any two beam motivators. Beam motivators create delicately warped corridors of subspace, and must be perfectly tuned to work correctly.

Units travel on a unit-by-unit basis.

All beams have unique tuning parameters that can be changed at any time.

Upon submitting an API request to travel from one beam motivator to another, the travelling unit must provide the tuning parameters for the destination beam.

If the tuning parameters for the destination beam are within <%5 tolerance, then transit occurs normally.

If the tuning parameters for the destination beam are between 5% and 50% tolerance, then the transiting unit is immediately destroyed, but both beam stations are left intact.

If the tuning parameters for the destination beam are between
50% and 99% tolerance, then the transiting unit and all other untis at the source beam station are immediately destroyed. The source beam station does not become uncontrolled at this point.

If the tuning parameters are 100% incorrect (totally inverted,) then the unit and the source beam station are immediately destroyed and a subspace inversion occurs at the source beam station, completely removing that outpost from the game map.

If 50% of all outposts are destroyed, this triggers subspace inversion cascade. Cascade travels along the beam network at FTL-speeds until it spreads to the entire map. Catastrophic galactical subspace inversion. Game over.

Beam stations can spontaneously face subspace inversion on normal, successful beam transit. This occurs randomly. The probability of subspace inversion is not ever known to the user. Every successful beam transit increases the probability of random subspace inversion.

Upon subspace inversion, subspace tears travel along the beam etwork (at a high decay rate) affecting all other outposts. Subspace tears also travel to every station which has travelled to or from the inverted station (at a lower but still high decay rate.)

Subspace damage can be repaired by setting beam motivator to REPAIR mode. This slowly rewinds previous subspace damage. In repair mode, units cannot transit FROM the outpost by beam. In repair mode, the outpost can be transited TO from any other outpost by beam without the need for tuning parameters. Transit TO a beam motivator in repair mode causes aggravated subspace damage.

**TODO:** what does the random inversion curve look like? It should start very slow but accelerate quickly to precipitate end-game.

**TODO:** what does the beam repair curve look like? It should start very slow, accelerating slowly. It should be reset in the event of beam transit.

**TODO:** can teams see inversion "waves" incident on their controlling station (thus knowing that someone lost an outpost, and, based on the strength, approximately where that outpost was)?

**TODO:** what does the decay rate look like? Penalize beam-connected stations more than FTL-connected stations. Decay rate should drop off very quickly (but still travel network-wide.) Decay rate via FTL and via beam-connectivity are cumulative. This should eventually penalise beam use, because everyone's home planet will be beam-connected to SOMEWHERE in the network.

**TODO:** what do tuning parameters look like? Should it be possible to (slowly) brute force them?

HYPERRELAY
----------

Teams can communicate via hyperrelay at any time. Hyperrelay is represented by individual team members ("diplomats") carrying physical materials (such as USB sticks) to other teams.

The USB sticks can contain any information.

Diplomats can also communicate verbally with other team members in order to strike deals, form alliances, trade beam tuning parameters. Diplomats cannot communicate with their home planet without physically returning to their team's area: they must work autonomously; they cannot merely relay messages between their leadership and other teams.

Players can contact referees at any time in the game, via communication channels established prior to game start. These communication channels should include low-visibility or covert options, such as SMS or e-mail.

Players are forbidden from forging messages to referees from other players.

At any time, a player may send a message to a referee asking to change teams. A player may rescind a team-change notification at any time.

Players who change teams too frequently or who change teams too close to game end may be penalized by referees.
